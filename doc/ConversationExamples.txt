INTRO:
Welcome to the Data Notebook.  I can help you find and explore various indicators. 

START:
  You have no indicators selected. Type some keywords and I will search for matches. (Ind name, description text, UN doc)
    Select the indicators to the right that interest you and hit "proceed".  
  
  Would you like to list your indicators, change filters, look at metadata or find new ones?
    All the indicators you have chosen are listed to the right.
  
Keyword - SEARCH:
  Great.  I can search for indicators by keyword or find indicators with similar slope. Which would you prefer?
    Please type in the keywords you would be looking for and I will display the matches in the right panel.
    Select the indicators to the right whose slope you want to match and hit "proceed".
  
Keyword - FILTER: (I can filter on any col/row in dataset that we care about. Two examples below.)
  You currently have x indicators selected.  I can filter these based on year, country, etc.  How would you like to proceed? 
    Would you like to set a start year or end year filter?
      What start year would you like to set?
      What end year would you like to set?
    What countries or regions interest you?
      Excellent. I have added this to your filters above.
      I don't know the region/country X.  Should I add it anyway?
    Are there any other filters you would like to create?
